## Status

*This is a toy project, there is no guarantee that it will be actively developed.*

**Working**:
* configurable syntax highlighting
* most of the syntax is accepted by the parser

**Coming next**:
* improve parser to support missing constructs
* detect Mint installation and run `mint` commands from the IDE
* navigation, find occurrences
